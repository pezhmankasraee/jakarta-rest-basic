# jakarta-rest-basic
This is a RESTful application developed in Java using Jakarta EE


Here’s a concise presentation outline summarizing the steps and troubleshooting we did together to get your **Jakarta EE 11 application working with GlassFish and H2 database**:

---

## **Jakarta EE 11 + GlassFish + H2 Integration: Step-by-Step**

---

### **1. Application Setup**

- **Created a Jakarta EE 11 project** with an entity class (`Student`) annotated with `@Entity`.
- Configured `persistence.xml` to use a JTA datasource and enabled automatic schema generation with:
  ```xml
    <property name="jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.database.action" value="create"/>
  ```
- Ensured the entity was correctly listed in the persistence unit.

---

### **2. GlassFish Server Configuration**

- **Added the H2 JDBC driver** (`h2*.jar`) to the GlassFish domain library (`domains/domain1/lib/`)[6][11].
- **Created a JDBC Connection Pool** in the GlassFish Admin Console:
    - Set the datasource class to `org.h2.jdbcx.JdbcDataSource`.
    - Configured properties: `user`, `password`, and `url` (JDBC URL for H2).
- **Created a JDBC Resource** (JNDI name, e.g., `jdbc/h2DS`) linked to the connection pool[6][8][10].
- **Tested the connection pool** using the “Ping” feature in the Admin Console to ensure connectivity.

---

### **3. H2 Database Configuration**

- Matched the **JDBC URL** in both GlassFish and the H2 Console to ensure both pointed to the same database file.
- Switched from using `~` (home directory) to an **absolute path** to avoid user path mismatches.
- **Added `;MODE=LEGACY` to the JDBC URL** to resolve compatibility issues with H2 2.x and EclipseLink’s DDL syntax for identity columns.

---

### **4. Troubleshooting & Resolution**

- **Checked server logs** for deployment and schema generation errors (enabled/adjusted logging as needed).
- Diagnosed and fixed a critical error:
    - EclipseLink-generated DDL was incompatible with H2 2.x’s new identity column syntax.
    - Solution: Added `;MODE=LEGACY` to the JDBC URL in both GlassFish and H2 Console, enabling legacy compatibility mode and allowing table creation to succeed.
- **Verified table creation** by inspecting the database in the H2 Console after deployment.

---

### **5. Key Lessons & Best Practices**

- Always ensure JDBC URLs are identical in GlassFish and H2 Console for consistent database access.
- For H2 2.x+, use `;MODE=LEGACY` if your JPA provider generates legacy DDL.
- Use absolute paths in JDBC URLs to avoid user-specific database locations.
- Enable and check server logs for troubleshooting deployment and persistence issues.
- JPA schema generation (`create` or `drop-and-create`) will create tables automatically at deployment-no need to insert data first.

If you switch from H2 to MySQL with GlassFish, the process is **very similar**-but you need to use the MySQL JDBC driver (`mysql-connector-java-x.x.xx.jar`) instead of the H2 driver. Here are the main differences and steps:

---

## **Key Differences: H2 vs. MySQL with GlassFish**

| Step                | H2 Database                                    | MySQL Database                                   |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **JDBC Driver**     | `h2*.jar`                                      | `mysql-connector-java-x.x.xx.jar`                |
| **Driver Location** | `domains/domain1/lib/`                         | `domains/domain1/lib/` (same location)[2][5][7]  |
| **JDBC URL**        | `jdbc:h2:/path/to/db;MODE=LEGACY`              | `jdbc:mysql://host:port/dbname`                  |
| **Datasource Class**| `org.h2.jdbcx.JdbcDataSource`                  | `com.mysql.jdbc.jdbc2.optional.MysqlDataSource`  |
| **Extra Steps**     | Sometimes need `;MODE=LEGACY` for H2 2.x+      | No legacy mode needed, but use compatible driver  |

---

## **Steps to Use MySQL with GlassFish**

1. **Download MySQL JDBC Driver**
    - Get `mysql-connector-java-x.x.xx.jar` from the [official MySQL site][7].

2. **Copy the Driver to GlassFish**
    - Place the JAR in `glassfish/domains/domain1/lib/` (same as with H2)[2][5][7].

3. **Restart GlassFish**
    - So the server picks up the new driver.

4. **Create a JDBC Connection Pool**
    - In the GlassFish Admin Console:
        - **Resource Type:** `javax.sql.DataSource`
        - **Datasource Classname:** `com.mysql.jdbc.jdbc2.optional.MysqlDataSource`
        - **Properties:**
            - `user`: your MySQL username
            - `password`: your MySQL password
            - `url`: `jdbc:mysql://host:port/dbname`
    - Ping the pool to verify connectivity[2][5][7].

5. **Create a JDBC Resource**
    - Link it to the connection pool.
    - Use the JNDI name (e.g., `jdbc/myDS`) in your `persistence.xml`.

6. **Update Your Application**
    - Reference the new JNDI name in `persistence.xml`.
    - No need for `;MODE=LEGACY` or H2-specific settings.

---

## **Summary**

- **Both H2 and MySQL drivers must be copied to `domains/domain1/lib/`.**
- **JDBC URL, datasource class, and connection properties will differ.**
- **No need for `;MODE=LEGACY` with MySQL.**
- **Use the correct MySQL driver version compatible with your GlassFish version** (some newer versions may not work with older GlassFish)[2][7].

## **Jakarta EE (GlassFish) Remote Debugging Tutorial (PART 1/2)**

### 1. **Enable Debug Mode in GlassFish**

- **Via Admin Console:**
    1. Open the GlassFish Admin Console in your browser (usually at `http://localhost:4848`).
    2. Navigate to:  
       `Configurations` → `server-config` → `JVM Settings`
    3. Under the **General** tab, find the **Debug Options** field.
    4. Set **Debug Enabled** to `true`.
    5. By default, the debug options will look like:
       ```
       -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=9009
       ```
        - `address=9009` is the debug port (you can change this if needed).

- **Via Command Line (Alternative):**
    - Start the domain with debug options:
      ```sh
      asadmin start-domain --debug domain1
      ```
    - Or set the debug JVM option in your domain’s config:
      ```sh
      asadmin create-jvm-options "-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=9009"
      ```

### 2. **Restart GlassFish**

- For changes to take effect, **restart the GlassFish server**.

### 3. **Attach Your IDE Debugger**

- In your IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans, etc.):
    1. Choose **Remote Debug** or **Attach Debugger**.
    2. Set the host (usually `localhost`) and the debug port (`9009` by default).
    3. Start the remote debug session.

### 4. **Set Breakpoints and Debug**

- Set breakpoints in your Java code where you want to pause execution.
- Trigger actions in your application (e.g., REST calls) to hit those breakpoints.
- Use the IDE’s debugger to inspect variables, step through code, and analyze the application’s behavior.

### 5. **(Optional) Enable Log4j2 Internal Debugging**

- Add the JVM option to see Log4j2’s internal status messages:
  ```
  -Dlog4j2.debug
  ```
- This helps troubleshoot logging configuration issues.

---

## **Quick Reference: Debug Options Explained**

- `transport=dt_socket`: Use socket transport for debugging.
- `server=y`: Listen for debugger connections.
- `suspend=n`: Do not wait for debugger to attach before starting.
- `address=9009`: Port number for debugger to connect.

---

## **Tips**

- Make sure your firewall allows connections to the debug port.
- Only enable remote debugging in development or testing environments, **not in production** for security reasons.
- You can change the debug port if `9009` is in use.

---

## **Sample Interview Answer**

> “To debug a Jakarta EE application on GlassFish, I enable debug mode in the server’s JVM settings, which sets up a JDWP socket on a specified port (like 9009). I then restart the server, and in my IDE, I use the remote debug feature to connect to that port. This lets me set breakpoints and step through my application code as it runs on the server. I also use JVM options like `-Dlog4j2.debug` to troubleshoot logging issues.”

Certainly! Here’s an updated, interview-ready tutorial on **remote debugging Jakarta EE (GlassFish) applications**, now including your requested points about `domain.xml`, the `server=n` vs `server=y` setting, and the difference between "listen" and "attach" in IntelliJ IDEA[1][2][3][4][6][9]:

---

## **Jakarta EE (GlassFish) Remote Debugging Tutorial (PART 2)**

### 1. **Enable Debug Mode in GlassFish**

- **Edit the Correct `domain.xml`:**
    - Find your domain’s `domain.xml` file, typically at:  
      `/domains//config/domain.xml`[3].
    - Look for the `` element.
      - Set `debug-enabled="true"` and configure `debug-options`.  
        Example:
        ```xml
        <java-config debug-enabled="true" debug-options="-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=9009" ... />

      ```
        - `server=y` means GlassFish will **listen** for a debugger to connect (the usual setup for server-side debugging)[2].
        - `address=9009` is the debug port (change if needed).
        - `suspend=n` means the server will not wait for the debugger to attach before starting.

- **Why `server=y` is Important:**
    - `server=y` puts the JVM in **"listen"** mode, so your IDE can **attach** to it as a client.
    - `server=n` means the JVM will try to connect out to a debugger, which is not typical for server debugging[2].
    - Always use `server=y` for debugging application servers like GlassFish.

- **Verify Configuration:**
    - After editing, you can verify your `domain.xml` using:
      ```
      asadmin verify-domain-xml
      ```
    - This checks for syntax errors in your configuration[3].

### 2. **Restart GlassFish**

- For changes to take effect, **restart the GlassFish server**:
  ```sh
  asadmin stop-domain domain1
  asadmin start-domain domain1
  ```
- On startup, you should see a message like:
  ```
  Listening for transport dt_socket at address: 9009
  ```
  This means the server is waiting for a debugger to attach[6][9].

### 3. **Attach Your IDE Debugger (IntelliJ IDEA Example)**

- **Listen vs Attach:**
    - GlassFish is in **listen** mode (`server=y`), so your IDE must **attach** as a client.

- **In IntelliJ IDEA:**
    1. Go to **Run > Edit Configurations**.
    2. Add a new **Remote JVM Debug** configuration.
    3. Set the host (usually `localhost`) and port (`9009`).
    4. Start the debug session (“Attach”).
    5. IntelliJ will connect to GlassFish, and you can set breakpoints and debug as usual[1][6].

- **If you use "Listen" in the IDE:**
    - This is for when the application (JVM) connects out to the IDE (rare for server debugging).
    - For GlassFish, always use "Attach" in your IDE, since the server is listening for incoming debugger connections.

### 4. **Troubleshooting Tips**

- **If you cannot connect:**
    - Double-check the port and firewall settings.
    - Make sure you edited the correct `domain.xml` for your running domain[2].
    - Ensure `server=y` in debug options.
    - Use `asadmin verify-domain-xml` to check for config errors[3].

- **Log4j2 Debugging (Optional):**
    - Add `-Dlog4j2.debug` to JVM options for detailed Log4j2 status output.

---

## **Quick Reference: Debug Options Explained**

- `transport=dt_socket`: Use socket transport for debugging.
- `server=y`: JVM listens for debugger to attach (**use for GlassFish**).
- `suspend=n`: JVM does not wait for debugger before starting.
- `address=9009`: Debug port.

---

## **Sample Interview Answer**

> “To debug a Jakarta EE application on GlassFish, I enable debug mode by editing the domain’s `domain.xml`, setting `server=y` so the JVM listens for debugger connections. After restarting GlassFish, I use my IDE’s remote debug feature to attach to the specified port. This setup lets me set breakpoints and step through server-side code. I always use `server=y` because the server should listen and the IDE should attach. If needed, I verify the configuration with `asadmin verify-domain-xml` and use Log4j2 debug output for logging issues.”

Certainly! Here’s a concise, interview-ready tutorial on building a **Jakarta EE bulk delete endpoint**, including why DELETE is problematic for bulk operations, and the recommended solution.

---

## **Jakarta EE Bulk Delete Endpoint: Tutorial & Best Practices**

### 1. **Why DELETE for Bulk Operations Is Confusing**

- **HTTP DELETE is designed for single resources:**  
  The HTTP spec and REST conventions expect DELETE to target a single resource identified by its URI (e.g., `DELETE /students/123`)[1][7].
- **Bulk delete with DELETE is a gray area:**  
  There’s no standard way to delete multiple resources in one request. Options include:
    - Sending multiple DELETE requests (inefficient for many items)[2][6].
    - Using a query string with multiple IDs (e.g., `DELETE /students?ids=1,2,3`), but URLs can become too long and unwieldy[6].
    - Sending a JSON body with IDs in a DELETE request (e.g., `DELETE /students` with `{"ids":[1][2][3]}`), but the HTTP spec says DELETE requests have "no defined semantics" for a body, and many servers, proxies, and frameworks ignore or reject it[4][6].
- **Inconsistent server support:**  
  Some servers and frameworks (including Jakarta EE implementations) do not reliably process bodies in DELETE requests, leading to errors or ignored payloads[4][6].
- **Result:**  
  This creates confusion and interoperability problems, making DELETE with a body unsuitable for bulk operations in most real-world APIs[2][4][6].

---

### 2. **The Solution: Use POST with a Bulk Delete Endpoint**

- **Industry best practice:**  
  Use a custom endpoint (e.g., `POST /students/bulk-delete`) and send the list of IDs in the JSON body[2][4][6].
- **Why POST works:**
    - HTTP POST is designed to accept a body and process complex operations.
    - Supported by all HTTP servers, frameworks, and proxies.
    - Clean, reliable, and scalable for large lists.

#### **Example DTO (Data Transfer Object)**
```java
public class BulkStudentRequest {
    private List ids;
    public BulkStudentRequest() {}
    public List getIds() { return ids; }
    public void setIds(List ids) { this.ids = ids; }
}
```

#### **Example Jakarta EE Resource**
```java
@Path("/students")
public class StudentResource {
    @POST
    @Path("/bulk-delete")
    @Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    public Response bulkDelete(BulkStudentRequest request) {
        // Validate and delete students by IDs
        return Response.noContent().build();
    }
}
```

#### **Example Client Request**
```http
POST /students/bulk-delete
Content-Type: application/json

{ "ids": [1, 2, 3] }
```

---

### 3. **Summary Table: Approaches for Bulk Delete**

| Approach                 | RESTful? | Supported? | Scalable? | Recommended?      |
|--------------------------|----------|------------|-----------|-------------------|
| DELETE per resource      | Yes      | Yes        | No        | ❌                |
| DELETE with query params | Partial  | Yes        | Limited   | ⚠️ (small lists)  |
| DELETE with JSON body    | No       | No         | Yes       | ❌                |
| POST with JSON body      | Yes*     | Yes        | Yes       | ✅ Best practice  |

> *POST for bulk operations is widely accepted in modern API design.

---

### **In Summary**

- **DELETE with a body is unreliable and confusing for bulk operations due to HTTP spec limitations and inconsistent server support.**
- **POST with a JSON body to a dedicated bulk-delete endpoint is the most robust and industry-accepted solution for Jakarta EE and other REST APIs[2][4][6].**

Here’s a **fast, interview-ready JPQL tutorial** with practical examples and key points, based on the JPA specification and official tutorials[3][4][8][10]:

---

## **JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language) Quick Tutorial**

### **What is JPQL?**
- JPQL is an object-oriented query language defined by the JPA specification.
- It lets you write queries against your Java entity objects, not directly against database tables[4][8].
- Syntax is similar to SQL, but uses entity names and field names.

---

### **How to Write and Execute JPQL Queries**

#### **1. Dynamic Query with `createQuery`**
```java
List customers = em.createQuery(
    "SELECT c FROM Customer c WHERE c.name LIKE :custName", Customer.class)
    .setParameter("custName", "Smith")
    .getResultList();
```
- Use `EntityManager.createQuery()` for queries defined in code[3][4].
- Use named parameters (e.g., `:custName`) and bind with `.setParameter()`.

#### **2. Named Query with `@NamedQuery`**
```java
@Entity
@NamedQuery(
    name = "Customer.findByName",
    query = "SELECT c FROM Customer c WHERE c.name LIKE :custName"
)
public class Customer { ... }
```
```java
List customers = em.createNamedQuery("Customer.findByName", Customer.class)
    .setParameter("custName", "Smith")
    .getResultList();
```
- Defined in metadata (annotation or XML), referenced by name in code[3][4].

#### **3. Positional Parameters**
```java
List customers = em.createQuery(
    "SELECT c FROM Customer c WHERE c.name LIKE ?1", Customer.class)
    .setParameter(1, "Smith")
    .getResultList();
```
- Uses `?1`, `?2`, ... instead of named parameters[3][4].

---

### **JPQL Syntax Basics**

- **SELECT**: Retrieve entities or fields.
    - `SELECT s FROM Student s WHERE s.age > 20`
- **WHERE**: Filter results.
    - `WHERE s.name = :name`
- **JOIN**: Navigate relationships.
    - `SELECT o FROM Order o JOIN o.customer c WHERE c.status = 'ACTIVE'`
- **UPDATE/DELETE**: Bulk operations.
    - `UPDATE Student s SET s.active = false WHERE s.age < 18`
    - `DELETE FROM Student s WHERE s.age < 18`

---

### **When to Use JPQL vs Criteria API**

- **JPQL**: Best for static, readable queries. Quicker to write and maintain[7][9][10].
- **Criteria API**: Use when you need type safety or to build queries dynamically at runtime.

---

### **Key Points for Interviews**

- JPQL queries operate on entity objects and their relationships, not tables and columns[4].
- Use named or positional parameters for flexibility[3][4].
- `createQuery` for dynamic queries, `createNamedQuery` for static (predefined) queries[3][4].
- JPQL supports SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE (but not INSERT).
- Prefer JPQL for simple, static queries; Criteria API for complex or dynamic queries[10].

---

**In summary:**  
JPQL is a SQL-like, object-oriented query language for JPA entities. Use it for most static queries, and switch to Criteria API only for dynamic or type-safe needs.

To update a `Student` entity in Jakarta EE 11, you typically use Jakarta Persistence (JPA) with an `EntityManager`. Here’s a simple, modern approach:

---

## **Steps to Update a Student Entity**

1. **Fetch the Entity:**  
   Use the primary key (e.g., `id`) to retrieve the existing `Student` from the database.

2. **Modify the Fields:**  
   Change the fields you want to update on the managed entity.

3. **Commit the Transaction:**  
   If inside a transaction, changes are automatically detected and saved when you commit.

---

### **Example Code**

```java
import jakarta.persistence.EntityManager;
import jakarta.persistence.PersistenceContext;
import jakarta.transaction.Transactional;

@Stateless
public class StudentService {

    @PersistenceContext
    private EntityManager em;

    @Transactional
    public void updateStudent(Long id, String newName, int newAge) {
        Student student = em.find(Student.class, id); // 1. Fetch
        if (student != null) {
            student.setName(newName);                // 2. Modify
            student.setAge(newAge);
            // 3. No need to call em.merge() if the entity is managed
        }
    }
}
```

- **Note:** If you’re using a detached entity (not managed by the current persistence context), use `em.merge(student)` to update it.

---

## **Key Points**

- The entity must have a no-arg constructor and be annotated with `@Entity`[2][3].
- Use the `EntityManager` to find and update entities within a transaction.
- Changes to managed entities are automatically persisted at transaction commit[2][3].

---

This is the standard, recommended way to update entities in Jakarta EE 11.

Would you like to see how to expose this as a REST endpoint as well?

Here’s a simple explanation:

When you fetch an entity using `em.find()`, that entity is **managed** by the current `EntityManager`. This means that any changes you make to it (like setting a new name or age) are automatically tracked, and when the transaction ends, JPA will save those changes to the database for you-**no need to call `em.merge()`**[2][4][6][8].

**Why?**
- A *managed* entity is already being watched by JPA, so it knows when you change its fields.
- `em.merge()` is only needed for *detached* entities-objects that were loaded in a different context or session, and are not currently tracked by the `EntityManager`[2][6][8].
- If you call `em.merge()` on a managed entity, it’s unnecessary and may even create a copy, which can be confusing.

**Example:**
```java
Student student = em.find(Student.class, id); // managed
student.setName("New Name"); // tracked automatically
// No need to call em.merge(student)
```
But if you have a detached entity (not managed), you must use `em.merge()` to reattach it so changes are saved.

**Summary:**
- **Managed entity (from `find()`):** Just change fields-JPA saves them automatically.
- **Detached entity:** Use `em.merge()` to reattach and update.

Let me know if you want a visual example or more details on managed vs detached entities!

Certainly! Here’s a layman’s explanation of those two points:

---

## **1. Exceptions Thrown Outside of JAX-RS Resource Handling**

Imagine your REST API as a series of steps:

1. **Step 1:** The server receives the HTTP request.
2. **Step 2:** The server tries to convert (deserialize) the incoming JSON into your Java object.
3. **Step 3:** If successful, your resource method (your Java code) runs.
4. **Step 4:** The server sends back a response.

**If something goes wrong in Step 2** (for example, the JSON is badly formatted, a required field is missing, or the data type is wrong), the error happens *before* your code runs.  
At this point, the server itself (not your code) throws the exception.  
Because of this, your custom error handlers (ExceptionMappers) in JAX-RS might not get a chance to handle the error and return a JSON response. Instead, the server might return a default HTML error page[6][9].

---

## **2. Exception Type Not Caught by Your Mapper**

Your ExceptionMapper only catches exceptions of the type you specify.  
If the error is a different type (for example, a low-level server error or something handled by the underlying web server or JAX-RS internals), your mapper won’t be used[2][5].

For example:
- If you write a mapper for `ConstraintViolationException`, but the error is a `BadRequestException` or a JSON parsing exception, your mapper won’t catch it unless you also write mappers for those types.
- Some errors (like HTTP 404 Not Found) are handled by the server, not by your code, so your mappers never see them[2][5][7].

---

## **Summary Table**

| Where Error Happens            | Who Handles It          | Can Your Mapper Catch It? |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| Before your code runs (parsing/deserialization) | Server/Framework          | Usually **No**            |
| Inside your resource method    | Your code/JAX-RS        | **Yes** (if type matches) |
| Server-level errors (e.g., 404)| Server/Servlet Container| **No**                    |

---

**In short:**  
Some errors happen so early (or at such a low level) that your custom error handlers never see them. Others are simply not the right type for your mapper to handle. That’s why you sometimes get an HTML error page even though you have ExceptionMappers set up.

Would you like advice on how to handle more of these errors as JSON?

# Exception handling in JAKARTA EE 11

Certainly! Here’s a clear, layered explanation of **where and how exceptions are caught and handled in a Jakarta EE REST (JAX-RS) application**, from the lowest (server) level up to your application code:

---

## **1. Servlet Container Layer (Lowest Level)**

- **What happens:**  
  The servlet container (e.g., GlassFish, Payara) receives the HTTP request and tries to route it to your JAX-RS application.
- **Examples of exceptions:**
    - Malformed HTTP requests (not even valid JSON or HTTP)
    - Invalid URLs (404 Not Found)
    - Unsupported HTTP methods (405 Method Not Allowed)
- **How handled:**  
  The container itself returns a standard HTML error page or a generic error response.  
  **Your ExceptionMappers do not see these errors.**

---

## **2. JAX-RS Framework Layer (Before Resource Method)**

- **What happens:**  
  JAX-RS parses the request, tries to deserialize JSON/XML into Java objects, and validates input using Jakarta Bean Validation.
- **Examples of exceptions:**
    - Malformed JSON (bad syntax)
    - Missing required fields
    - Validation errors (e.g., `@NotNull` fails)
    - Parameter binding errors (e.g., wrong data type in query/path param)
- **How handled:**
    - Some exceptions (like validation errors) can be caught by your custom `ExceptionMapper` if registered and if the error is thrown after JAX-RS takes control[2][8].
    - **But:** If the error occurs before JAX-RS hands control to your resource method, or if the error is a type not mapped (e.g., deserialization errors), it may be handled by the framework or container, often resulting in a generic HTML or plain-text error[2].
    - Some frameworks (like Jersey) throw `BadRequestException` or similar, which you can map with an `ExceptionMapper`.

---

## **3. Resource Method Layer (Your Code)**

- **What happens:**  
  Your resource method is called (e.g., `@POST`, `@GET`), and your business logic runs.
- **Examples of exceptions:**
    - Business logic errors (e.g., user not found, invalid operation)
    - Uncaught runtime exceptions (e.g., `NullPointerException`)
- **How handled:**
    - Any exception thrown here can be caught by your registered `ExceptionMapper` for that type (e.g., `ExceptionMapper`, `ExceptionMapper` for generic errors)[6][8].
    - The mapper can return a custom JSON response, HTTP status, etc.

---

## **4. Service/Business Layer (Called by Resource)**

- **What happens:**  
  Your resource method calls service classes, which may throw custom or runtime exceptions.
- **Examples of exceptions:**
    - Domain-specific exceptions (e.g., `UserNotFoundException`)
    - Data access errors
- **How handled:**
    - These exceptions bubble up to the resource method, and then are handled as above (by ExceptionMappers, if registered)[1][5].

---

## **Summary Table**

| Layer                     | Example Errors                | Who Handles It                | Can ExceptionMapper Catch? |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Servlet Container         | 404, 405, malformed HTTP      | Servlet container             | ❌ (No)                   |
| JAX-RS Framework (pre-resource) | Malformed JSON, validation fails | JAX-RS, Bean Validation, or container | Sometimes (if type mapped and after JAX-RS takes control) |
| Resource Method (your code) | Business logic, runtime errors | Your ExceptionMappers         | ✅ (Yes)                  |
| Service/Business Layer    | Domain/business exceptions    | Bubble up to resource method  | ✅ (Yes, if not caught earlier) |

---

## **Key Points**

- **Not all errors reach your ExceptionMappers.**  
  Some are handled by the server or framework before your code runs.
- **ExceptionMappers work best for exceptions thrown in or after your resource methods.**
- **For full JSON error coverage:**
    - Register mappers for common framework exceptions (e.g., `ConstraintViolationException`, `BadRequestException`).
    - Accept that some errors (like 404 or malformed HTTP) will be handled by the servlet container, unless you configure custom error pages at the server level.

---

**Would you like practical examples of mappers for each layer, or advice on configuring server-level error handling for JSON responses?**

You might need to override `getClasses()` in your `JakartaRestConfiguration` (your class extending `Application`) **to explicitly control which resource and provider classes are registered in your Jakarta REST (JAX-RS) application**[4][5][8][9].

---

## **Why Use `getClasses()`?**

- **Explicit Registration:**  
  By default, Jakarta REST will scan your application for all classes annotated with resource (`@Path`) or provider (`@Provider`) annotations and register them automatically[4][5][9].
- **Custom Control:**  
  If you override `getClasses()` and return a non-empty set, **only** the classes you list will be registered as REST resources or providers (such as ExceptionMappers)[4][5][8].
- **Use Cases:**
    - You want to control exactly which endpoints and providers are available (for security, modularity, or testing).
    - You want to avoid classpath scanning (for performance or deployment reasons).
    - You need to register resources/providers that are not annotated or are created programmatically.

---

## **How It Works**

- If you **do not override** `getClasses()` or `getSingletons()`, Jakarta REST scans and registers all annotated classes it finds in your application[4][5].
- If you **do override** `getClasses()` or `getSingletons()` and return a non-empty set, **only** those classes are registered-automatic scanning is disabled[5][8].

---

## **Example**

```java
@ApplicationPath("/api")
public class JakartaRestConfiguration extends Application {
    @Override
    public Set> getClasses() {
        Set> classes = new HashSet<>();
        classes.add(MyResource.class);
        classes.add(MyExceptionMapper.class);
        // Add more resources/providers as needed
        return classes;
    }
}
```

---

**In summary:**  
Override `getClasses()` when you want full control over which REST resources and providers are part of your application. If you do, remember to list all resources and providers you need, as automatic scanning will be turned off[4][5][8][9].

Would you like to see when it’s better to rely on scanning vs. explicit registration?
